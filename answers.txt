Subject: Application for the Casual IT Position

Dear Mr. Washingmachine,

My name is Nicholas and I am currently looking for IT roles, particularly around East Melbourne. 

I have recently heard from a mutual friend of ours about a potential position at Monash IT Consulting. I believe I possess the necessary skills and interest in working at Monash IT Consulting. I have attached my resume with an in-depth overview of my capabilities that I am able to bring to the company.

Please do not hesitate to contact me regarding any queries.

Thank you,
Nicholas Chong

Q1)
Websites tend to be tertiary sources that acquire the information from other sources with a specific intent that will most of the time be different from the original intents of the information. For example, a website may tend to exagerate information in order to make a profit.

This is problematic as seeking information through search results will lead to the researcher collecting information only based on the search result's bias and may have numerous problems such as misinformation, bias, omission of information.

Q2)
Once the research has been collected and analysed, the results should be synthesised in such a way as to persuade the stakeholders of a claim through the trends found from the data.

Q8) 
The body language of the audience will provide insight into how successful the dissemination was. Reading cues such as puzzled looks, frowns, confused faces will clearly show frustration from the audience as a result of a lack of understanding of the new system. This will indicate that further evaluation will need to be considered to allow the employees to understand how the new system works.
